# nucleOS #

## What is this? ##
nucleOS is my rendition of an operating system for the STM32 Nucleo development boards.

This OS is being developed on an STM32-Nucleo H743ZI

## Current State ##
Currently, nucelOS is going through a rewrite in which local unorganized test code is being rewritten and optimized before being compiled into this repository.
